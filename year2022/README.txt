Couple of notes:
Scoring for leaderboards is based on speed, so my code is messy and not well commented.
Using Java instead of something easier like Python because my summer internship wants me to be good at Java.
My separate code for each day is in separate classes. They all have compute() methods so I can run it through a general main() class.
The main() class is literally just sout(dayN.compute()); so I'm not gonna paste it here.
Each question has two parts, so my final code will answer part two. It should always be an extension of part one.
